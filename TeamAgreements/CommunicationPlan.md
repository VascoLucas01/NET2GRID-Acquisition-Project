Diogo:


**- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

We will make point-of-situation overviews at the end of each working day to always be aware of each other’s progress and any help they might need. This way everyone knows each other's difficulties and successes.


**- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

Sérgio: By having an open-door policy to all questions and problems, making sure that there are no silly questions and that all questions are valid as well as actively asking how work is going.

Vasco: I will always ask for their opinion. We are a team, so we need to know everyone’s opinion to the benefit of the project.
