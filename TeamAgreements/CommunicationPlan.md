## **Communication Plan**

**- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

Slack, Remo, WhatsApp, SMS

- How often will you take breaks?

Sérgio: Sundays I tend not to spend a lot of time in front of the computer, unless urgent.

Vasco: Thursday and Sunday from 8am - 10am.

Diogo: Friday night


**- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

Sérgio: Ask my colleagues for help, work locally outside work hours if needed.

Vasco: Talk with my colleagues about what am I doing wrong and ask for help.

Diogo: Talk with my colleagues about my work, why I’m struggling and ask for help.

Sérgio: I will always be available for a quick message and to help a colleague either via Slack, WhatsApp or SMS.

**- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

We will make point-of-situation overviews at the end of each working day to always be aware of each other’s progress and any help they might need. This way everyone knows each other's difficulties and successes.


**- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

Sérgio: By having an open-door policy to all questions and problems, making sure that there are no silly questions and that all questions are valid as well as actively asking how work is going.

Vasco: I will always ask for their opinion. We are a team, so we need to know everyone’s opinion to the benefit of the project.

Diogo: Will ask my team for their opinion, be open minded.
