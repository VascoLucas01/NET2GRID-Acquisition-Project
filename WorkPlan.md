## **Work Plan**

**NOTE**: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.


**- How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

By reading the summary together and building a network topology of what is required we can then check which tasks need to be done, then we can try to use our strengths identified above to assign those tasks accordingly following everyoneâ€™s opinion. We will know when things are complete when a member of the team completes a task and then the other members verify that it does what is needed for the project and that it is working flawlessly. 


**- What project management tool will be used?**

GitHub, link for our project will be: [VascoLucas01/NET2GRID-Acquisition-Project (github.com)](https://github.com/VascoLucas01/NET2GRID-Acquisition-Project)
