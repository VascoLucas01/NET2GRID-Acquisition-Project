# NET2GRID-Acquisition-Project

GlobeX has made a number of strategic acquisitions this year, but the IT infrastruture of the new subsidiary companies is outdated. In order to maintain the levels of regulatory complaince required for federal contracts, GlobeX needs to update and reconfigure its subsidiary's IT infrastructure. For each acquisition, a task force has been assembled under the umbrella of the GlobeX special projects division to accomplish this project.

Our team has been assigned to assist with standardizing IT infrastructure for NET2GRID. 

> NET2GRID is a young, innovative company that offers leading-edge AI and machine learning services in energy insights based on smart meter data whose vision of a world with sustainable energy aligns well with the mission of GlobeX
