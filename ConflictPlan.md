## **Conflict Plan**

**- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

The best way to resolve conflicts is by expressing your opinion. I think that there are a few questions that we should always ask to come to a conclusion. 

**- What is your opinion about this?**
**- What are the reasons you think that it is a good/better idea?**
**- In the context of the project, do you think it makes sense?**

It is important to share ideas and be in the same boat in order to reach a good port.


**- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

This was the first topic discussed in the group. The idea not to leave anyone behind.

Knowing that this is a team project, we need to conclude it as a team and not try to highlight ourselves from the colleagues just to prove a point.

**- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

We will make sure to ask questions about our colleagues' work in order to understand what each person is doing at any given time. Apart from that, we need to be patient with each other. It is important that everyone understands the project and the idea behind it at a high level before jumping in to details.

**- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

We know each other and the commitment we all have with this course. This will not be a problem, but if it happens the idea is to talk with that member and understand the reason behind it, maybe there’s a simple solution that we can work on and improve everyone’s work.

**- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

The key is to keep ourselves calm and  de-escalate any type of conflicts promtly. During our professional lives we will need to overcome a lot of barriers and difficulties. In fact, this is just the beginning and it is important to start dealing with that in a better way. In the rare case of  a conflict becoming unmanageable the best approach is with a 2 to 1 or 3 to 0 vote to escalate to either a TA or the lecturer.
